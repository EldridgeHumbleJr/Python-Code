#The Purpose of this program is to answer the question "How many days will it take SMAP to
#image all of Earthâ€™s surface? This question comes from JPL's(Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Education
#Activity Titled "Pi In the Sky". This program uses the mathematical formulas in the answer to
#calculate the answers using the Python programming language.
